      <joist-description>
        Web components are fantastic but sometimes you will find that what they provide is to "low
        level" to be productive.

        <br />

        The goal of the Joist is to add just enough on top of web components to bridge that gap.
        Joist is tiny overall and by using decorators (optional) the api has you add things on TOP
        of your custom element code. Think of it less like you are writing "Joist code" and you are
        just "using" joist.

        <br />

        A good example is @joist/observable.

        Let's say you have a custom element like so.

        <code>
          <!-- Insert example -->
        </code>

        @joist/observable lets you monitor changes on any marked property.
        Joist will then call your onPropertyChanged function and let you know what changed so you can respond accordinly.
        You don't create a "JoistElement" or have to call in yourself. You just tell joist what you want, and it does it.
        
        <code>
          <!-- Insert other example -->
        </code>
    </main>
